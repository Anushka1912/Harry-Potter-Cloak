# ðŸ§¥ Invisible Cloak using OpenCV

This project creates an **Invisible Cloak Effect** using Python and OpenCV by detecting a specific color (red) and replacing it with a pre-captured background.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Detects **red cloak** in real-time.
- Replaces the detected cloak area with the background.
- Uses **OpenCV's HSV color space** for color detection.
- Applies **morphological transformations** for smooth masking.
